File structure for media files (jpgs,videos, and backups)
NOTE: Maintaining the media file structure in github allows you to run 
git clone https://github.com/dhs-envirotech/timelapse.git
in the home/pi directory, and have the complete file structure.
SUGGEST: Just having a single build script that adds ffmpeg, flask, imagemagic, etc in one simple script.
and then making a crontab entries file with possible cron entries to make it all work.
